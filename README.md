# Heritage Hive E-Commerce Project
# It is an innovative e-commerce platform designed to connect local artisans from around the world with a global customer base. Its mission is to facilitate the sale & exhibition of heritage items, thereby aiding in the preservation of global cultural heritage. The platform supports local economies by empowering small businesses and rural families by getting remittance, and it also serves an educational purpose by providing detailed cultural information about each item. With a focus on user-friendly design and sustainable, ethical trade practices, "Heritage Hive" aspires to be more than just a marketplace. The platform will serve as a global marketplace, bringing together artisans and buyers in a unique online space where the rich heritage of different nations is showcased and exchanged.
