Welcome to the next installment of our course, where we guide you through the process of getting started with a Dockerized Django application. In this video tutorial, we'll hold your hand as we walk you through the steps of cloning a GitHub repository, understanding the project's file and folder structure, and preparing to dive into coding.

We'll focus on the practical aspects of acquiring the project and gaining an understanding of its inner workings.

During this hands-on tutorial, you will:

1. Discover the GitHub Repository: Learn how to find and select a suitable GitHub repository that contains the Dockerized Django application you'll be working with.

2. Clone the Repository: Follow along as we guide you through the process of cloning the repository, creating a local copy on your machine for exploration and modification.

3. Examine the File and Folder Structure: Take a closer look at the project's file and folder structure, understanding the purpose of key files and directories.

4. Preparing for Coding: Gain confidence as we explain the essential components and dependencies of the Dockerized Django application, setting the stage for your coding endeavors.

Welcome to the next video lecture in our course! Building upon the foundational knowledge from the previous lectures, this session focuses on an often overlooked yet crucial aspect of web application development: how to make our app deployable.

In this video, we delve into the process of making our Django application deployable, starting from either the main branch or a new branch in the GitHub repository. You have the flexibility to either make the necessary changes directly in the main branch or clone down the new branch, depending on your preference and workflow.

Throughout the video, we methodically walk you through the essential changes that are required. One of the key aspects we address is the management of environment-specific settings. While the standard settings.py file may work in production environments, it can become unwieldy and difficult to maintain with multiple if-else statements. To address this, we explore the concept of a common settings file that is inherited by environment-specific setting files, promoting cleaner code and easier maintenance.
